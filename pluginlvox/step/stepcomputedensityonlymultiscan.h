/** \class  StepComputeDensityOnlyMultiScan
    \brief  This step aims at discretizing in voxels a pointcloud scanned by a T-LiDAR and calculating for each voxel a density index, then for each voxel determine the scanner describing it best.

            This index was presented in a previous articel written by by J.F. Cote, J.L Widlowski, R.A. Fournier and M.M. Verstraete.
